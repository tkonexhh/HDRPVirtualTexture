## Add a Volume

To add a Volume to your Scene and edit its Volume Profile:

1. Go to **GameObject** > **Volume** and select one of the options from the list.
2. In the Scene or Hierarchy view, select the new GameObject to view it in the Inspector.
3. In the **Volume** component, assign a Volume Profile to the **Profile** property field. If you want to create a new Volume Profile, select **New** next to the property field.
4. The list of [Volume overrides](volume-component.md) that the Volume Profile contains appears below the **Profile** property. Here you can add or remove Volume overrides and edit their properties.

Refer to the following for more information:

- [Volume component](volume-component.md)
- [Configure volume overrides](configure-volume-overrides.md)
